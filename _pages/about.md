I am a PhD candidate at [Emerging Embedded Technologies Lab](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/?_gl=1*18pxsz3*_gcl_au*MTQ1Njg4MTcwOS4xNzAxNDYwNTI0*_ga*MTEzNjM2Nzk3OC4xNjc3NzExMjA3*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwMzQ0NjEyOC4xMDAuMC4xNzAzNDQ2MTI4LjAuMC4w), University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I am advised by [Prof. Fatima Anwar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NiFGpXoAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on building a [trusted time architecture](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/?_gl=1*18pxsz3*_gcl_au*MTQ1Njg4MTcwOS4xNzAxNDYwNTI0*_ga*MTEzNjM2Nzk3OC4xNjc3NzExMjA3*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwMzQ0NjEyOC4xMDAuMC4xNzAzNDQ2MTI4LjAuMC4w#projects), for networked cyber physical systems, by diversification of clock sources and use of commodity hardware based trusted execution environments. More broadly, I am interested in using designing secure services for cyber phsycal systems at the network edge. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to improve system security. Prior to joining UMass, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [VisionX](https://visionx.io) and [PackageX](https://packagex.io), Pakistan. I did my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at NUST, Pakistan.
