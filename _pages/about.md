I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UMass Amherst, working in the [Emerging Embedded Technologies Lab](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/?_gl=1*18pxsz3*_gcl_au*MTQ1Njg4MTcwOS4xNzAxNDYwNTI0*_ga*MTEzNjM2Nzk3OC4xNjc3NzExMjA3*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwMzQ0NjEyOC4xMDAuMC4xNzAzNDQ2MTI4LjAuMC4w) (EmTech Lab), under the supervision of [Prof. Fatima Anwar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NiFGpXoAAAAJ&hl=en).

<strong>I am actively seeking full-time industry opportunities for summer/fall 2023.</strong> I am interested in designing trustworthy system software, particularly applications and OS services supported by secure primitives in trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as ARM TrustZone. I am also passionate about embedded systems and sensor networks, which power critical cyber-physical infrastructure. I enjoy solving complex problems and applying the machine learning and signal processing skills I’ve developed throughout my career.

During my Ph.D., I’ve worked on building a [trusted time architecture](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/?_gl=1*18pxsz3*_gcl_au*MTQ1Njg4MTcwOS4xNzAxNDYwNTI0*_ga*MTEzNjM2Nzk3OC4xNjc3NzExMjA3*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwMzQ0NjEyOC4xMDAuMC4xNzAzNDQ2MTI4LjAuMC4w#projects) for networked cyber-physical systems. This project involved diversifying clock sources and leveraging commodity hardware-based trusted execution environments.

Before joining UMass, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PackageX](https://packagex.io) and [VisionX](https://visionx.io) in Pakistan. At PackageX, I contributed to the development of an "address extraction and parsing" technology for mail package labels in over 10 languages, which was deployed across 15+ countries. At VisionX, I was involved in the research and development of an Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system, an image-to-text application designed to process music sheet images.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Electrical Engineering from School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/) at NUST, Pakistan in 2017.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in nature, especially hiking and exploring mountainous areas. I also like learning about a wide range of topics online, from astronomy to history, and I’m always fascinated by feline behavior —- often through watching cat videos. Occasionally, I unwind by watching cricket.
